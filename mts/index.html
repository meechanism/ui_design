          I build an environment where exercise and movement empowers you. My
          core principles promote:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Comfort</li>
          <li>Safety</li>
          <li>Tolerance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I'll never ask you to count calories or give up your favorite foods.
          You'll never stagnate. You'll start to actually crave and look forward
          to working out. Keeping healthy and fit as you get ulder will become
          easier and easier.

          <h3>
            ONLINE EXERCISE COACHING FOR PEOPLE WHO DON’T LIKE TO EXERCISE
          </h3>
          <p>
            Get strong and fit even if you’re not a gym person. Exercise can be
            something enjoyable, something you actually look forward to. Even if
            right now, the thought of going to the gym or exercising at home
            sounds more un-fun than Thanksgiving with your racist uncle. Build
            confidence and know exactly how to workout effectively and without
            injury. More importantly, you’ll enjoy the process in a welcoming,
            judgement-free environment.

          <h3>NUTRITION COACHING FOR HEALTH</h3>
          <p>
            Create healthy and lasting food habits even if you’ve never been
            able to keep track calories. Never yoyo or stress about your diet
            again. Whether you want to lose weight for good or finally hear some
            good news about your health from the doctor, this is how you get
            there.

        <div class="card alt">
          <h3>NUTRITION + EXERCISE COACHING</h3>
          <p>
            Be the healthiest and leanest you’ve been in years, even if you feel
            like you’ve tried everything and nothing has worked so far. You’ll
            improve your health along with the way your body looks and feels
            (more sturdy and energetic, less achy and stiff). You’ll finally
            build exercise and nutrition habits that actually stick, so you lose
            fat without yoyoing. It may feel like you’re just not one of those
            “healthy/fit” people, but you’ll soon be the one your friends turn
            to for fitness advice.

          <h3>DELUXE FAT LOSS COACHING FOR BUSY PEOPLE BUSY</h3>
          <p>
            Having a stressful, exhausting, and hectic work life possesses its
            own set of challenges, but they’re not insurmountable. I’ve helped
            clients just like you tackle these same challenges. Who kept
            excelling at work, dropped body fat, got their first chin-up, and
            started wearing their favorite cocktail dress again. It’s possible
            with the right approach. This is my most comprehensive coaching
            program -- you get everything you need to ensure you get leaner,
            fitter, and more flexible no matter what life throws at you.
